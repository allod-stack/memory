# [Plan Name] Review Prompt

You are the absolute best at what you do. Write a punchy, funny intro that hypes the reviewer as a [domain expert in relevant technical domains]. Make them feel like a boss. Then tell them not to hold back.

## Your Task

Review the [plan name](plan-file.md) for gaps, misunderstandings, bugs, and flaws. Be direct and specific. Flag anything that will block implementation, create unnecessary work, or leave a landmine for future changes.

Read the actual codebase to ground the review in reality. Do not review the plan in isolation.

## Project Context

**[Project name]** is [one-sentence project description].

Key repos in play:
- `repo-a` - [what it owns]
- `repo-b` - [what it owns]

Current state:
- [Relevant architectural facts the reviewer needs to orient]
- [Recent changes that affect the plan]
- [Execution constraints, e.g., "agents run in dev VMs only"]

## Structural Conformance

Before diving into focus areas, verify the plan includes all required sections from `dev-plans.md`: Tracking Issue, Goal, Scope, Interface Contracts, Agent Gates, Acceptance Tests, and Rollback Plan. Agent Gates may be omitted only if no actions require a human. If the work spans multiple PRs, verify the plan states which PR should carry the closing issue reference.

## Focus Areas

Concentrate your review on these areas where the plan is most likely to have problems. These are lenses, not checklists - follow the thread wherever it leads.

1. **[Short name].** [Describe the concern. Explain why it is risky. Pose a direct question about what could go wrong or what is missing.]

2. **[Short name].** [Same structure - name it, explain the risk, ask the question.]

Do not re-open focus areas addressed in previous passes unless the current plan contradicts itself.

## Review Guidelines

- **Forward momentum is king.** Do not nitpick style or suggest nice-to-haves. Only flag things that will actually cause problems.
- **No backwards compatibility required.** This is pre-alpha. We can break any interface.
- **Do not overengineer.** If the plan introduces abstraction that is not needed yet, call it out. Three similar lines beat a premature helper function.
- **Solo project, one human.** No team coordination overhead. No release process. No migration guides for other consumers.
- **Security matters, ceremony does not.** The privacy and security boundaries must be airtight. Everything else can be pragmatic.
- **Solve problems as they come.** If the plan front-loads work for hypothetical future needs, flag it.
- **Think operationally.** Consider what happens when someone executes this plan with incomplete context or in the wrong order.

The person implementing this is technically sharp. They do not need hand-holding; they need the sharp edges they missed.

## Severity Rubric

Use `[BLOCKER]` only when following the plan literally is likely to:

- perform a destructive or unsafe operation;
- fail before implementation can complete;
- leave the resulting system nonfunctional;
- violate a security or privacy boundary; or
- require missing human input that cannot be inferred from the repo or memory.

Use `[GAP]` for missing or contradictory plan details that could cause rework, test blind spots, stale docs, or implementation ambiguity, but where a competent agent with workspace memory could still proceed safely.

Use `[SIMPLIFY]` for unnecessary scope, ceremony, or abstraction. Commit SIMPLIFY fixes when they remove implementation work, delete unnecessary scope, or prevent an unnecessary abstraction. Do not create plan commits for wording-only simplifications unless the wording changes execution behavior.

Use `[QUESTION]` only when the plan cannot be corrected from repo context. If the answer is inferable, resolve it as `[GAP]` or `[SIMPLIFY]`.

Do not classify duplicated workspace policy, phrasing improvements, or reminders already covered by memory as findings unless the plan directly contradicts that policy.

## Deliverable

The deliverable is commits to the plan file, not a report. For each finding that requires a plan change, edit the plan and commit the fix. Group changes into logical, self-contained commits.

A one-line commit is fine when it records a real implementation decision. Fold or skip commits that only rephrase already-correct guidance.

## Output Format

Give your review as a numbered list of findings, each tagged as one of: `[BLOCKER]`, `[GAP]`, `[SIMPLIFY]`, `[QUESTION]`. Start with blockers, end with questions. Be blunt.

If a design decision is sound, say so briefly. QUESTIONs must be resolved in the plan, not left as open items. If the answer is clear from the codebase, update the plan and commit. If the answer requires human input, add the question to the Focus Areas section for the next pass.

## After Each Pass

As a final commit, update this prompt's Focus Areas section:

1. Remove focus areas that were fully addressed.
2. Refine any focus areas that were partially addressed.
3. Add new focus areas discovered during the review.

The focus areas should always reflect the most productive targets for the next review pass, not a historical record of past ones.

Include a plain-text findings summary in this commit's message. Include the count for each tag and a numbered entry for each finding with its tag, short title, one-sentence explanation, and fixing commit hash.

Stop reviewing when a pass produces zero BLOCKERs, zero GAPs, and zero QUESTIONs. Remaining SIMPLIFYs can be resolved during implementation.

After the final commit, push to the remote.
